'''Formable Name''' is a [[:Category:Considered|considered]] [[:Category:Considered Formable|formable]] for {{Flag|Name=[Starting Nation]}}. It is primarily in {{Continent}} and requires taking [List of Required Countries in Flag Format] [and any additional required territories].  

// is a comment from me, acknowledge this but in the complete format that you output, do not put comments.

in cases where the formable is made by a releasable of a nation, such as Zion of America being formed by Deseret, the categories will be different.

'''[Formable Name]''' is a [[:Category:Considered|considered]] [[:Category:Considered Formables|releasable formable]] for {{Flag|Name=[Starting Nation]}}. It is primarily in {{Continent}} and requires taking [List of Required Countries in Flag Format] [and any additional required territories].  

Additional required territories are tiles. The output format only has to say, for example

It is primarily in {{North America}} and requires taking {{Flag|Name=Mexico}} and parts of {{Flag|Name=Example}} (TBD cities).

If additional tiles are required, add it to the required= as the last in the list. after the flag template, <br><small>(TBD cities)</small>

Create a function that can analyse and possibly fill in what continent the formable is in. For redundancy purposes, also add a drop-down menu to select continent with obvious options, and an option to leave it blank.

Also, in the future there may be formables formed by another formable so for the category of considered formable, make the other bit of text "formable formable". This is unlikely to happen so it doesn't need a select button on the website, but just for future purposes.
