| decision_description = With the collapse of the Mongolian Empire, four vast Empires were declared in its dusk by the Great Khan's sons: the Yuan, Ilkhanate, Golden Horde, and the Chagatai. Reaching from the Altai to the Southern Aral, the Chagatai were among the most feared on the steppe, leaving a massive mark on our culture for centuries. But now, with the Great Khan’s spirit and lands reestablished, we can take vengeance on those who destroyed our ancestors’ legacy and revive this once-great empire to project fear in the Steppe once again.

| alert_description = After the Mongol Empire's fall, its vast domain fractured into four successor states: the Yuan Dynasty, Ilkhanate, Golden Horde, and Chagatai Khanate. The Chagatai, once masters of Central Asia, ruled a land where nomadic traditions and military might shaped history. They became a dominant force on the steppe, leaving a lasting mark on its culture and warfare. Now, with their lands reclaimed and legacy revived, they stand ready to restore their former glory and reassert their mighty empire.
